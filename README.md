An online scratchcard game. Do you feel lucky?

## Instructions

In order to run the project locally you need to start both the client (this repository) and the server, that can be found in its own repository, [Scratch Bonanza Server](https://github.com/michaelkolesidis/scratch-bonanza-server)

Install the project dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Start Vite:

```
yarn dev
```

### Demo

There is also an online deployment of _Scratch Bonanza_ that can be found in [here](https://scratch-bonanza.vercel.app/). The online version is deployed in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and is configured to use an online deployment of the server, deployed in [Render](https://render.com/).

When using the online version, you should note that loading the first scratchcard will usually take around 15-20 seconds, as the project is hosted using the free tier of Render, thus the server sleeps when inactive.

## Features

- Each scratchcard features four scratchable areas that have a reward hidden underneath
- Five different reward options: **1**ü™ô, **10**ü™ô, **100**ü™ô, **1000**ü™ô or **0**üçå
- Scratching sound while scratching implemented both on touch and on non-touch devices
- Help modal available in all screens
