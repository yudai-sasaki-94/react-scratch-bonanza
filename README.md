**An online scratchcard game. Do you feel lucky?**

There are five different rewards with different sounds, 1ü™ô, 10ü™ô, 100ü™ô, 1000ü™ô or 0üçå. It is a full-stack implementation, with the rewards generated on the server.

## Instructions

In order to run the project locally you need to start both the client (this repository) and the server, that can be found in its own repository, [Scratch Bonanza Server](https://github.com/michaelkolesidis/scratch-bonanza-server).

**1.** Start the server.

**2.** Install the project dependencies:

```
yarn
```

**3.** Start Vite:

```
yarn dev
```

### Demo

There is also an online deployment of _Scratch Bonanza_ that can be found in [here](https://scratch-bonanza.vercel.app/). The online version is deployed in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and is configured to use an online deployment of the server, deployed in [Render](https://render.com/).

When using the online version, you should note that loading the first scratchcard will usually take around 30-50 seconds, as the project is hosted using the free tier of Render, thus the server sleeps when inactive. On rare occasions, the server might take up to 5 minutes to respond to the first call.

## Features
